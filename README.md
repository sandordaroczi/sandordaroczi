👋 Hey there, Servus, Üdv! My name is Sándor. I am a Mathematics master's student at the Technical University of Munich, originally from Hungary.

💻 I am passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Probability Theory, Algorithm Analysis, and Mathematical Optimization.

🔬 I have already a bit of experience with the following languages & sofware: Python, R, Java, C++, Tableau, Databricks, Git, SQL, Terraform

🌱 I want to take on any exciting opportunity to improve my skills and learn new technologies. Right now, I am curious to learn about Software Development, NLP, and Data Engineering.
